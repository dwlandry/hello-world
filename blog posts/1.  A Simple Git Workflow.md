# A Simple Git Workflow for Solo Developers
Working on a personal project solo doesn't mean you shouldn't follow a good Git workflow. A solid workflow helps maintain code quality, track changes, and easily revert to a previous version if needed. In this blog post, we'll go through a simple Git workflow for making small changes to a C# WinForms application in Visual Studio.
## Step 1: Fetch and Pull
Before making any changes, ensure you have the latest version of the code by fetching and pulling from the master branch.

```sh
git fetch origin
git pull origin master
```
## Step 2: Create a New Branch
Instead of making changes directly on the master branch, create a new branch for your changes. This allows you to keep your working branch separate from the stable master branch.

```sh
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
Replace your-feature-name with a meaningful name related to the changes you're making.

## Step 3: Make Your Changes
Make the necessary changes to the code, and commit them locally. It's recommended to commit changes frequently, with descriptive commit messages.

```sh
git add file1.cs file2.cs
git commit -m "A brief description of the changes"
```
Replace file1.cs file2.cs with the files you've modified.

## Step 4: Push Your Branch
Once you've completed your changes and committed them, push your branch to the remote repository.

```sh
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```
## Step 5: Create a Pull Request
Go to your GitHub repository, and create a pull request (PR) to merge your changes from the feature branch into the master branch. Review your changes, and ensure that everything looks good before merging.

## Step 6: Merge the Pull Request
After reviewing the changes, merge the PR. This will apply your changes to the master branch.

## Step 7: Delete the Feature Branch
Once the PR is merged, you can delete the feature branch locally and remotely to keep your repository clean.

```sh
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
```
## Step 8: Pull the Changes
Finally, switch back to your master branch and pull the changes to ensure your local master branch is up-to-date.

```sh
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```
By following this simple workflow, you can keep your codebase organized and maintain a clear history of changes, even when working on small changes or solo projects. Happy coding!
