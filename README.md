# Hello World!!
My hello world repository via GitHub recommendation.  In addition to going through the 'Hello-World' tutorial, I'll also be us this repository to store various project ideas.

My name is David and I've been working with a Engineering/Design/Construction/Consulting firm in the oil and gas industry since 2007.  I really enjoy learning and try hard to apply new knowledge to productive work output.  I have an amazing family - married with 4 kids.  One great thing about having kids, is being inspired by their creativity!  There are times when, approached with a new problem,  I find myself spending more time analyzing, while they will jump right on in and start trying to apply the very first solution that comes to their head.  This can be a great approach, because you can quickly start making progress - sometimes that progress is realizing that the initial solution might not be the best, but it is still progress none the less.  This has encouraged me to beef up my hardware inventory at the house - so that if anyone has an idea we can more tools at our disposal - such as soldering station, arduio, raspberry pi, motor kits, led kits, large whiteboard for brainstorming, etc.

## GitHub Plans
I'd like to make using GitHub a part of my regular routine.  I regularly develop various tools to assist in my daily work activities - historically these have been MS Excel based.  It seems to me that GitHub could be a great place for me to store these various projects, share with others, and get some feedback.  Right now these little projects tend to get spread across various hard-drives on different machines and I even forget about some tools that I have created.
