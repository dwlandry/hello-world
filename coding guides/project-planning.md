Building a C# WinForms enterprise application with constantly changing requirements can indeed be challenging, especially when you're working alone. However, by following some best practices and organizing your work, you can stay focused and maintain a structured codebase. Here are some suggestions:

## Plan and document your architecture:
Before diving into coding, take the time to plan your application's architecture. Create a high-level overview of the components, layers, and interactions between them. Document your design decisions and update them as requirements change.

## Break down tasks into manageable chunks:
Break the project into smaller, manageable tasks, and prioritize them according to importance and dependencies. This will help you stay organized and make it easier to track progress.

## Use version control:
Use a version control system like Git to manage your source code. This will help you keep track of changes, maintain a history of your work, and easily switch between different versions of your code.

## Follow SOLID principles:
SOLID is a set of design principles aimed at making your code more maintainable, flexible, and scalable. By following these principles, you can create a codebase that is easier to modify and extend as requirements change.

## Implement a modular design:
Organize your code into smaller, focused modules with well-defined responsibilities. This will make it easier to add, modify, or remove features without affecting other parts of the system.

## Automate testing and deployment:
Automated tests and continuous integration can help catch issues early and ensure the quality of your code. Set up automated testing for your application and use continuous integration tools to automatically build and deploy your code when changes are pushed to the repository.

## Use a project management tool:
Use a project management tool like Trello, Asana, or GitHub Projects to track your tasks, deadlines, and progress. This will help you stay organized and prioritize your work.

## Schedule regular code reviews and refactoring:
Regularly review your code to identify areas for improvement, and refactor as needed to maintain a clean and organized codebase. This will help you stay focused and ensure your code remains maintainable and scalable.

## Stay up-to-date with technology and best practices:
Continuously learn and stay informed about new technologies, libraries, and best practices in software development. This will help you make informed decisions and improve the quality of your work.

## Manage your time effectively:
As a solo developer, managing your time effectively is crucial. Allocate time for focused work, breaks, and learning. Break your work into smaller time-boxed sessions (e.g., using the Pomodoro Technique) to maintain focus and productivity.

By following these practices and staying organized, you can successfully develop a C# WinForms enterprise application even with changing requirements and as a solo developer.
